Flood Monitoring &amp; Alerting System is an Arduino-based project that uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure water levels in real time. The system displays the level on an LCD and provides visual alerts using LEDs for safe, warning, and danger conditions. It is suitable for flood-prone areas, water tanks, and drainage monitoring applications.
